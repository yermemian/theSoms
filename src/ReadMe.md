## Project Abstract 
This project will be similar to the Sims, where the game begins with a certain number of people that are allowed to mingle and form relationships with each other. New people may be added from existing characters having kids. People may leave the game by dying.

## Project Design  
This project will be written using Java. It will be written using four classes: a main class, a person class, a gameplay class, and a test class. The main class will process inputs and outputs from the user and call on methods from other classes. The people class will store the characters in the game as their own objects. The gameplay class will have methods for things such as dying, and being born. The test class will include tests for the people class.
 
## Game play
When you start the game you will be asked to name your town, decide how many people you want to live there and name your first person. THen the game will start and people will start being born, and will die throughout the game. The game will only end if everyone dies and the population reaches 0.
